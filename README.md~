Hi there!

Welcome to:
*****A Sophomoric Investigation into Parallel Programming******
   *****Using the Java Fork-Join Framework*****

In order to run the program, you will need to following steps:
1. Unzip the archive
2. Run the command "make" inside the directory to generate the .class files
3. Place testing files (eg inp1.txt, inp4.txt) into the directory in order to test the program
(These were not added so as keep the archive small).
4. Run the command "java Assignment_1" and follow the prompts!

Enjoy!
